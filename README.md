## Project Overview

This project is part of my learning journey through courses I have taken on Udemy. It focuses on understanding and implementing React Router and several built-in React hooks such as `useNavigate()`, `useParams()`, `useSearchParams()`, as well as global state management using **React Context API**.

All materials and concepts used in this project are based on the following course by Jonas Schmedtmann:

- [The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=CP251118G4)

> ⚠️ **Note**  
> This project was created **strictly for educational purposes** and is not intended for production use.

I hope that by working on this project, I can continuously expand my knowledge and strengthen the foundation of my career path as a Full Stack Developer.

## Tech Stack

- React
- React Router
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Context API
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vite
- Git & GitHub

## Application Features

- Save and track your travel experiences around the world
- Easily add a visited location with a single click on the map
- View a list of countries you have already visited

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aim to:

- Understand how **Single Page Applications (SPA)** work with React Router
- Learn how to read and manipulate the URL
- Manage global state without external state libraries
- Structure a React application in a clean and scalable way
- Improve code readability and maintainability

## Things I Learned

Key concepts and skills practiced in this project include:

- Building Single Page Applications using **React Router**
- Implementing programmatic navigation with `useNavigate()`
- Reading and updating URL query parameters using `useSearchParams()`
- Accessing dynamic route parameters with `useParams()`
- Declarative navigation using `<Navigate />`
- Managing global state with the **Context API**
- Combining multiple contexts to keep the codebase clean
- Understanding **data flow** in React applications
- Implementing **guard components** for route protection
- Structuring components and folders for better maintainability

## Thanks

Thank you for visiting this repository.

I plan to continue improving this project by adding new features beyond the course material and refactoring the code to follow better best practices.

This project is part of my long-term learning process and career path toward becoming a Full Stack Developer.
