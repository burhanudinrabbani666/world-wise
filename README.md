## Project Overview

This project is part of my learning journey through courses I have taken on Udemy. It focuses on understanding and implementing React Router and several built-in React hooks such as `useNavigate()`, `useParams()`, `useSearchParams()`, as well as global state management using **React Context API**.

All materials and concepts used in this project are based on the following course by Jonas Schmedtmann:

- [The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=CP251118G4)

This project was created strictly for educational purposes and serves as a hands-on practice environment to better understand routing, state management, and application structure in React.

I hope that by working on this project, I can continuously expand my knowledge and strengthen the foundation of my career path as a Full Stack Developer.

## Tech Stack

- React
- React Router
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Context API
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vite
- Git & GitHub

## Things I Learned

- Using React Router to build Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Implementing dynamic navigation with useNavigate()
- Reading and updating URL query parameters using useSearchParams()
- Accessing route parameters using useParams()
- Using declarative navigation with `<Navigate />`
- Managing global state using the Context API
- Structuring React applications more cleanly and maintainably
