# ROUTING A SINGLE PAGE

- with routing, we match **different URL** to **differnet UI views** (React Components): **Routes**
- this enable user to navigate between different applcations screen, using the browser URL.
- keeps the UI in sync with the current browser URL.

## SINGLE-PAGE-APP

- Application that is **executed entirely on the client** (browser)
- **Routes:** different URL correspond to diffenret views (components)
- **Javascript:** (React) is used to update the page (DOM)
- **The page is never reloaded**
- Feels like a **native app**
  Additional dta **might be loaded** from web API
